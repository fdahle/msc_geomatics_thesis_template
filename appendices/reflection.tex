\chapter{Reflection}

At P4 a draft reflection must be handed in. A final version of the reflection must be included as a distinct part of the thesis (a separate chapter) or as a separate document at the P4.
In this reflection the student uses a short substantiated explanation to account for the results of the research in the graduation phase (product, process, planning).
Depending on the research, reflection on a number of the following aspects should be included (you may choose in which order). 
The reflection should be in the form of a text, with diagrams and sketches for purposes of illustration and clarification.

\begin{description}
  \item[Aspect 1] The relationship between the methodical line of approach of the Master Geomatics and  the method chosen by the student in this framework.  
  \item[Aspect 2] The relationship between the conducted research and application of the field  geomatics.
  \item[Aspect 3] The relationship between the project and the wider social context.
