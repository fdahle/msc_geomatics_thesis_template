The cover (front + back) must be manually updated with your details and own figure.

To do so, you must either:
  - edit the PDF directly in Illustrator;
  - use the PSD files in Illustrator, edit them and export to PDF; (I haven't tested them, just exported from another software)
  - use the afdesign file if you have a Mac and the software Affinity Designer (https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/); great but not free.

If your figure has lighter colours, use the black logo of TU Delft provided.
